##Audio classification / Sound recognition

**Introduction**

​	Automated sound recognition has a wide range of applications, from music and song tagging to algorithms built to identify failure reasons in complex machinery.

​	Audio classification can also be used by a house assistant AI to enhance the interaction experience with a user (human). By "knowing" what the human is currently doing the house assistant can help with the activity, offer next steps or simply be more human-like and say:  "Have you brushed your teeth yet?" An ability to build a daily routine schedule of a human might open additional opportunities for the AI to offer potential schedule optimizations or develop surveillance and safety protocols.

**Goals**

​	Develop classification algorithms for house related sounds.

**MVP**

​	Minimum Viable Product for this project is a model that can recognize human speech from other house related noises.

**Data**

*Google AudioSet*.  A library of manually annotated sound recordings.

*YouTube*.  Sound recordings of speech and house sounds.

*Self recorded audio events*. Recordings of speech and house sounds.

**Conclusions**

​	A ability to classify sounds brings in endless possibilities for expanding the house assistant AI's functions. For instance, you could add a "no-one home" monitoring algorithm for surveillance based on your normal daily routine. AI could monitor young children from letting you know that a  baby is crying in a given room or reminding your child to brush her teeth. It could remind you to take your computer with you when you leave for work etc.
